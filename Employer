My name is Dylan Jurgensen, I majored in finance and marketing at the University at Albany, SUNY. I have worked for Chase Bank for 2.5 years.
My goal is to learn as much as I can about FinTech to advance my career.
The FinTech field is forever changing and want to be at the forefront of it in 2023.
